# MUSIX-Capstone

MUSIX was my junior year capstone project. The application is a music-based social media software that allows users to share their music interests via geographical locations, add friends, view their favorite songs/playlists and much more! Using the Google Maps API, ReactJS, and Bootsrap CSS our five person group created the app over the course of Junior year using the Agile Software development process.
