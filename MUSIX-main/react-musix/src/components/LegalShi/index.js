//       <SmallText>
//         If you have any issues we do not yet have a contact email, and realistically we don't want to hear any of your problems as this is a school project and we do not care. But if you absolutely must reach us, reach our professor at <a href="mailto:mohan@syr.edu">mohan@syr.edu</a>.

//       <SmallText>
//         We reserve the right to change these terms whenever we please, however any changes directly involving our users will be preceeded by a notification to said users about the changes. Also, as previously stated, by using MUSIX you are agreeing to these terms. Any failure to abide by this page can result in termination of your MUSIX account. I am pretty confident no one reads these things so if you made it this far I hope you are having a great day, and that you live a long and prosperous life.
